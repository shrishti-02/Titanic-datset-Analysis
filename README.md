# Titanic-datset-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Data Analysis of Titanic dataset.
I participated in the competition at kaggle. The main purpose of doing this project was to build my skills and develop my understanding towards 
machine learning, predictive modelling, and to explore the data. 
Basically to understand how many passengers onboard titanic could survive given the various aspects and attributes.
I refered to various sources available on Kaggle to complete this project. 
I completely enjoyed throughout!!
And, I can say I have learned a lot, and looking forward to learn more.
