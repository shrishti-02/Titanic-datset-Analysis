# Titanic-datset-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Data Analysis of Titanic dataset.
This project I have done to participate in the competition at kaggle. The main purpose of doing this project is to build my skills and understanding towards,
machine learning, predictive modelling, to perform exploratory data analysis. 
Basically to understand how many passengers onboard titanic could survive given the various aspects and attributes.
I refered to various sources available on Kaggle to complete this project. 
I completely enjoyed throughout.
And, I can say I have learned a lot, and looking forward to learn more.
